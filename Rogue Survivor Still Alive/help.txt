TROUBLESHOOTING

-The game crashes on launch

	In your Intel control panel set "3Dtexture" to "Quality".

-(sound) I can't hear any sounds or music
	Run the game configuration utility (RSConfing.exe) and try other the video and audio engine (SFML/MDX).
	Check the in-game options menu to ensure you haven't turned off sounds or music, or lowered their volume.

-(sound) A sound is stuck playing at the start of every turn
	Save your progress (Shift+S) and then exit the game. The looping sound will be gone when you restart the game.
