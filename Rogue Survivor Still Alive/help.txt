TROUBLESHOOTING

-(crashes) The game crashes on launch
	Right-click RogueGame.exe and select 'Run as administrator'. Please report the issue on the forums.

-(crashes) Game crash when multitasking
	Run the game configuration utility (RSConfig.exe) and try other the video and audio engines.	

-(interface) The game text is blurry
	If you have an Intel onboard GPU (ie no dedicated graphics card), open the Intel control panel and set "3Dtexture" to "Quality".
	Dedicated graphics cards provide similar configuration options that are forced at the driver level, and therefore apply to
	all games. Check the Control Panel for your flavour of grpahics card.

-(sound) I can't hear any sounds or music
	Run the game configuration utility (RSConfing.exe) and try other the video and audio engine (SFML/MDX).
	Check the in-game options menu to ensure you haven't turned off sounds or music, or lowered their volume.

-(sound) A sound is stuck playing at the start of every turn
	Save your progress (Shift+S) and then exit the game. The looping sound will be gone when you restart the game.

-(ffdshow) ffdshow spams instances in the task bar
	Open ffdshow configuration, go to DirectShow and set "Multiple ffdshow instances" to "none".

-(sound) I turned off sound effects but I still hear rain.
	For technical and indolence reasons rain counts as music. Sorry.

-(sound) Some sounds don't always play when they should (eg gunshots).
	This is due to technical limitations, but may be addressed in future versions.

-(interface) Sometimes the controls stop responding / I'm prompted do something without seeing any pop-up text.
	This is a deficiency in the video engine and will be address in a future version.
