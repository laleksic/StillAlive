TROUBLESHOOTING

-(crashes) The game crashes on launch
	If it's a 'file not found' error you may need to install DirectX 9.0c. You can get it here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=8109
	If you installed DirectX 9.0c and it still crashes, try right-clicking RogueGame.exe and select 'Run as administrator'.
	Please report the issue on the forums if it still doesn't work.

-(crashes) Random game crashes
	Run the game configuration utility (RSConfig.exe) and try other the video and audio engines.	

-(sound) I can't hear any sounds or music
	Run the game configuration utility (RSConfing.exe) and try other the video and audio engine (SFML/MDX).
	Check the in-game options menu to ensure you haven't turned off sounds or music, or lowered their volume.

-(sound) A sound is stuck playing at the start of every turn
	Save your progress (Shift+S) and then exit the game. The looping sound will be gone when you restart the game.

-(sound) Some sounds don't always play when they should (eg gunshots).
	This is due to technical limitations, but may be addressed in future versions.

-(interface) Sometimes the controls stop responding / I'm prompted do something without seeing any pop-up text.
	This is a known issue and will be addressed in a future version. Trying pressing Escape, Enter or N (for No) to get around it.

-(interface) The game text is blurry
	If you have an Intel onboard GPU (ie no dedicated graphics card), open the Intel control panel and set "3Dtexture" to "Quality".
	Dedicated graphics cards provide similar configuration options that are forced at the driver level, and therefore apply to all games. Check the Control Panel for your flavour of grpahics card.

-(ffdshow) ffdshow spams instances in the task bar
	Open ffdshow configuration, go to DirectShow and set "Multiple ffdshow instances" to "none".

-(modding) I've changed one of the game's image, sound or Excel files but it was overwritten.
	The game will deploy it's own content files whenever their last modified date is more recent than that of any file using the same name.
	To ensure your files are used instead, change their last modified date to be today. NirSoft's BulkFileChanger or Romain Petges' Attribute Changer 9 make this easy.
