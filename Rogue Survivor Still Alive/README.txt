WHAT IS THIS

This is the game source from 2012. I did not touch it since then.
There is no data files or resources, you have to download the game for that (see next section).
There is no project files or libraries. They are probably obsolete by now anyway and I don't even know if the code will compile in recent C# compilers/IDEs.
I can't provide support for compiling or answer code/gameplay questions, it's been a long time and I've moved on. I hope you'll understand!


GET THE GAME

The original blog where you can get the game is still alive, so go there:

You'll need this for the resources (data files, images etc...)


WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH IT

Anything but nothing commercial please. See the license file.


THANK YOU & CLOSING WORDS

That's a thank you from ME to YOU guys!
Some of you guys have some serious dedication for this game! It is both scary and awesome... scarysome!?
Sorry for failing you by not working more on the game or being more responsive!
From time to time I secretly tried to revive the game or start a new incarnation. I didn't tell you guys because all I had to show was a couple of prototypes that didn't go very far and I didn't want to repeat the RS2 fiasco...
Anyway, I don't plan on updating the game, so go ahead and have fun!!
