NOTE: CHANGES BELOW ARE THE ORIGNAL WORK OF RoguedJack PRIOR TO RELEASE AS OPEN-SOURCE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALPHA 9 CHANGES (28th April 2012: http://roguesurvivor.blogspot.com.au/2012/04/alpha-9-release.html)
---------------

Undead hunger and rotting.
Living sanity and insanity, cannibalism.
Medics can try to revive recently deceased people.

FIXED BUGS
1 (Rules) Cannot fire at or make an enemy of an indirect enemy.
2 (Item) Scent killer is not equipable anymore and the NPCs never use them.
3 (Options) Supplies drop option effect is reversed.
4 (Options) Some options are irrelevant to VTG mode but still enabled and used in computing difficulty.
5 (Wtf) Can drag more than one corpse but not really, causing bugs.
6 (Inventory) Partial stacks do not stack correctly in some situations : more is added than what isdropped.
7 (Murder) Cops can murder without consequences. Consequences will never be the same.

NEW GAMEPLAY : UNDEAD ROT
- Most undeads slowly rot away and have to eat flesh, similar to how livings have to eat food.
- Bite/eat people/corpses to recover points.
- When Hungry an undead may loose a skill each turn.
- When Starved an undead may loose 1 HP per turn.

NEW GAMEPLAY : SANITY
- Livings should try to keep their Sanity.
- Sanity slowly decays.
- There are 3 levels of Sanity :
    - Sane : nothing happens.
    - Disturbed : nightmares.
    - Insane : nightmares plus insanity sometimes taking control of the living actions and doing random things.
- Livings seeing or doing disturbing actions take a sanity hit.
    - butchering a corpse.
    - eating a corpse (living cannibalism is worse).
    - eating someone alive.
    - zombification and corpse rising.
    - death of follower/leader with whom the living had a bond (see below)
- Recover sanity by:
    - forming and keeping a bond with followers/leaders (see below)
    - using entertainment items (see blow).
    - taking some meds (yellow pills).
    - killing undeads.

NEW GAMEPLAY : CANNIBALISM
- Livings can eat corpses when starving or insane.
- Eating corpse recovers a bit of food points but transmit infection and is disturbing for sanity.
- Nutrition value is low, Light Eater helps a bit.

NEW GAMEPLAY : REVIVE
- Can try to revive corpses.
- Need : medic skill, a medikit, the corpse must be fresh.
- Chances depends on the skill level and the state of the corpse.
- A revive attempt consumes the medikit even if failed.
- Big boost in trust if not enemies.

NEW ITEMS : ENTERTAINMENT
- Using recovers sanity.
- Have a chance to become "boring" after each use.
- A "boring" item has no value anymore to the character who found it boring (but may still have value for other people).
- Books : good entertainment value.
- Magazines : stackable but low value and discarded once read.

FOLLOWERS
- Bond:
    - when max trust is reached, a "bond" is formed between the leader and the follower.
    - a bond helps both livings recovering sanity, it is reassuring to know there is someone you can count on in this insane world.
    - however, when the "bonded one" dies, the living takes a sanity hit.
- Followers remember the trust they had in their previous leader(s). Eg: leave a follower behind and he will remember the trust he had in you if you lead him again.

GAMEPLAY
- Trees are now breakable and give wood.
- Wood from broken objects is not limited to one full stack of planks. Eg: trees = 10 planks (4,4,2).
- Trap: small actors (rats) have 90% chance to avoid triggering a trap.
- Murder: killing an agressor of a leader/mate count as self-defence and is not a murder.
- Indirect enemies: extended to include relations with respective leaders.

SKILLS
- New Z-Skill : Z-Light Eater, similar to living Light-Eater.
- Modified skill zombification : Light Eater becomes Z-Light Eater; Z-Eater has to be learned as zombie.
- New Skill : Strong Psyche - stay sane longer and recover more san.

AI
- Followers: When fleeing/retreating, try to avoid stepping into their leader line of fire.
- Improved speed advantage evaluation : intelligent NPCs are much better at controlling range when they have a ranged weapon or are fighting a slower enemy (less stupid deaths).
- Starved or Insane hungry livings will eat corpses.
- Some livings use entertainment items.
- Intelligent NPCs will avoid stepping into traps that could kill instantly them unless starving or courageous/wreckless (gangs).
- Civilians will temporarily loose interest in an item stack they can't reach (eg:blocked by deadly traps).
- Not afraid anymore of stepping on empty cans ^^
- Not interested in ranged weapons if already have one.
- Civilians will trade with each other, but they won't annoy the player and remember with who they traded recently as to not spam trade offers.
- Civilians with medic skill will revive others.

MODDING
- Meds can recover San.
- Items_Entertainment.csv

ALPHA 8 CHANGES (4th February 2012 : http://roguesurvivor.blogspot.com.au/2012/02/alpha-80-release.html)
---------------

Traps and Z-Skills.
Self-defence. A bit more useful followers.
Gangs that act as looters and CHAR Guards that act as guards, rather than them being just another enemy to kill.
Armors helps or hinder escaping Gangs and Police attention.
New shop.

FIXED BUGS
1 (Crash) Destroying a dragged corpse and then moving.
2 (AI) Trying to get an item in a large fortification.
3 (Glitch) Flaslights out of batteries still functioning.
4 (AI) Won't equip a ranged weapon out of ammos even if has ammo in inventory (noticable when you change AI fire directives).
5 (Typos) Various.
6 (Gfx) GDI+ doesn't display some 32 bits PNG properly (fucked up some mods like Deon Apocalypse).
7 (Lack of Nazis) Every decent game should have Nazis.
8 (Glitch) Invading Zombiefieds incorrectly have spawn time 0.
9 (Glitch) Overlays were sometimes not displayed (damage icons, blue popups..)
10 (Trolling) The readme is outdated and mentions a "RS Install.exe". Idiot.
11 (Glitch) PostMortem: difficulty inflation.
12 (Glitch) PostMortem: follower skill upgrade logged as yours.
13 (UI) Sometimes misses a combination of keys (Shift/Ctrl/Alt + key).


GAMEPLAY
- Personal enemies: Self-Defence and Indirect Enemies.
    - Makes the distinction between being the Aggressor or acting in Self-Defence.
    - If X attacks or declares Y as a personal enemy, X is the aggressor and Y is acting in Self-Defence (duh).
    - Killing in Self-Defence is not a murder.
    - Indirect enemies: X is not an aggressor or being aggressed by Y, but they are enemies through their relations (leader or followers are enemies).
    - Indirect enemies are enemies as long as the cause is there (eg: respective leaders or mates are enemies). Once it is gone they are no more enemies.    
- Undead: separate set of upgrade skills for undeads. See skills below.
  When a living is zombified, some of its skills are zombified too.
- Corpses: rising zombies have starting HP proportional to the corpse state.
- Gangs: 
    - Start neutral with civilians, but still enemies to Police and Army.
    - Attack people who have items they want.
- Wearing some armors modify the chances to move unnoticed by Police and Gangs.
  - The effect cumulates with the Unsuspicious skill.
  - Hostile outfits = +50% chances; Friendly outfits = -50% chances.
  - Police: Hostile = all bikers armors; Friendly = all police armors.
  - Bikers: Hostile = all police armors and rival gang armor; Friendly = same gang armors.
  - Gangstas: Hostile = all police and bikers armors; Friendly = none.
- CHAR Guards: they now act more like guards.
    - Start neutral to Civilians, Police and Army.
    - But attack anyone who trespass CHAR offices or the CUF.
- Refugees: 
    - Some of them arrive in the subway and the sewers too.
    - They get one skill per day - after all, they are supposed to have survived up to this day just like you.
    - More varied items - everything you can find in shops and houses.
    - After Day 7 they might bring more rare items like grenades, army ammo...
- Survivors: the van guys get more skills.
- New Shop: Hunting Shop.
- Standing/climbing on top of cars/fences increase view range.
- VTG: since VTG has no evolution by definition the option is turned off to compute the difficulty properly; to get 100% again setting ZUp Days to 1 is fair.
- Bikers, Gangstas and Soldiers get additional skills depending on the day they arrive.
- Living player starts game with Food and Sleep not maximized, just like NPCs.

NEW GAMEPLAY : Z-SKILLS
- Undead set of skills
  Z-Agile, Z-Strong, Z-Tough: like their living counterpart but lower values.
  Z-Eater: regen more HP from bites/eating corpses.
  Z-Grab: % of chance to prevent any adjacent enemy from moving (passive skill)
  Z-Infector: more infection damage from bites.
  Z-Tracker: improve smell - do not confuse with the item.
- Zombification of skills is straightforward:
    Agile/Strong/Though -> Z-Agile/Z-Strong/Z-Tough
    Light Eater -> Z-Eater
    Light Feet -> Z-LightFeet
- Z-Grab, Z-Infector and Z-Tracker must be learned as zombie.

NEW GAMEPLAY : TRAPS
- Traps are items. 
- Activate a trap, drop it on the floor and anyone/anything who/which enters the tile might trigger the trap (even yourself).
- Stacks: activating/dropping only activates/drop one trap of the stack.
- A triggered trap can deal damage and/or make loud noises and/or trap the victim in the tile.
- Some traps need to be manually activated (use), other traps activates automatically when dropped on the ground.
- Some traps desactivate when triggered, they have to be re-activated.
- Some traps can be stacked together.
- Since traps are just items, you can put many of them in the same tile.
- To escape a trap, just try to move.
- Armors do not protect from traps!
- Some map objects allows you to safely move over traps.
- Pushing some map objects on traps triggers them.
- 4 Traps available : Empty Cans, Spikes, Barbed Wire and Bear Trap.

SKILLS
- new Light Feet/Z-Light Feet: improve chances to avoid/escape a trap.
- Unsuspicious : helps evade gangs attention too (in addition to help avoiding the police)

- Z-Strong: undeads can push (Strong too).

FOLLOWERS

- Pushing help: followers will automatically help pushing objects. 
    - They must be idle or following you, awake and adjacent to the pushed object.
    - Each helping follower takes a share of the stamina cost and spend normal action points.
    - Eg: pushing a 100 weight object with the help of one follower = 50 sta cost you and him.

---------------

Lots of new stuff most notably : Game modes with Infection and Corpses.

FIXED BUGS
- (n/a)

NEW GAMEPLAY - GAME MODES
- When starting a new game you choose a game mode...
- STD - Standard - the standard game like in previous versions
    recap:
    - evolution.
    - different types of zombies.
    - instant zombification.
- C&I - Corpses & Infection
    - disabled instant zombification. 
    - livings are infected by some undead bites (the ones who regain their hp when they hit you). see below for details on infection.

- Special case for the player : will immediatly turn into a zombie if dying infected (no corpse).

NEW GAMEPLAY - INFECTION (if game mode has it)
- Infection rated as % of actor resistance to infection.
- Resistance to infection = infection "hitpoints" = actor max Hitpoints + max Stamina.
- As infection % increase there are ill effects.
- 100% or more infection can trigger death.
- Does not increase or decrease by itself over time : heal with meds, worsen with bites.

NEW GAMEPLAY - CORPSES (if game mode has them)
- A corpse will slowly decay to finally turn into dust and disapear.
- A corpse might raise to become a zombie, with a delay of 6 hours (the infection takes some time to revive the dead).
- Chances to raise depends on a number of factors :
    - the time since death.
    - the infection level of the living who died.
    - corpses are much more likely to raise at night.
- Explosions (grenades) damage corpses.

    - examining corpses will give you more info :
        at level 1 = estimation of date of death.
        at level 3 = estimation of infection.
        at level 5 = estimation of chances to rise as a zombie.

FACTIONS
- new Gangs: There are now 2 gangs of Bikers & 2 gangs of Gangsta. 
  Each gang is an enemy of the other one and they will fight each other.

ACTORS
- Zombifieds: with the AGILE skill can jump like the ZM does.
- Zombifieds: with the STRONG skill can push like the ZM does.

    - the corpses are rotated and scaled gfxs of actors.

SFX
- Sfx when a corpse rise.
- Sfw when an undead eat a corpse.

PERFORMANCE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALPHA 6.3 CHANGES (7th January 2012 : http://roguesurvivor.blogspot.com.au/2012/01/alpha-63-release.html)
-----------------

New improved armor (protection) system. Most Stats doubled to allow more items and skills variation.

FIXED BUGS
1. (Glitch) Random number generator might go insane when "Synchronous Simulation" is enabled (noone can hit anybody, Agile is always rolled etc...)
--> I never had this one happen to me, need players feedback to confirm it fixed or not!
2. (Glitch) Could not redefine some keys.
3. (Typo) Fun facts.
4. (Glitch) Player can see scents when sleeping.

GAMEPLAY
- New improved armor/protection system.
  Armors have now 4 stats:
  - Protection vs Hits : damage absorbed in melee.
  - Protection vs Shots : damage absorbed when shot.
  - Encumbrance : penalty to Defence value.
  - Weight : penalty to Speed value.
  Protection vs blasts (explosions like grenades) is the average of the two protection values.
- Unique refugee NPCs arrive with other refugees rather than being there at the start of the game.
- Famu Fataru has a unique Katana.

UI
- Actor description shows armor rating.
- new options: "Show Targets" and "Always Show Player Targets"
  "Show Targets": when mouse over an actor, will show which actor this actor is targetting and if the actor is being targetted.
  "Always Show Player Targets": will "Show Targets" on the player; in practice this is helpfull to notice when you are being targetted as players can easily fail to notice the "targetting you!" icons.

AI
- AIs are now allowed to pickup,trade or use unique items like JM Axe and FF Katana.
  The subway badge is the exception and still forbidden to AIs.

DATA
- A bunch of stats have been doubled. Ex: double hit points, double damages etc... This will allow more variation in items and skills.

- Modified some weapons stats.

2. (Glitch) Simulation timer wasn't checked properly.

OPTIONS
- new: "Synchronous Simulation" (enabled by default)
  If on, the simulation on the nearby districts runs while you are playing in your district.

  Disable this option if the game feels less responsive or sluggish, especially on low end computers.
- "District Simulation" by default up to FULL to take advantage of the new sim feature.
- Limited reincarnation turned off by default (was on).

GAMEPLAY
- Stench killer : nearby stench killer odor is now visible to living players (pink circle), so you can easily see where you or AIs used the sprays (its rare but yes the AI does spray).
- New Action: Recharge battery powered items - equip the item and bump into a powered generator, recharge 1 hour worth of battery.
  Careful not to drop items out of battery you want to recharge later, they are still discarded!
- Difficulty: doesn't factor in Districts Simulation option anymore.
