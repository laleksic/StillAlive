---------------------

**********ALPHA 10 CHANGES, MERGED INTO STILL ALIVE:

FIXED BUGS
(1) (Stability) Ordering followers to drop all items could crash the game.
(2) (Rules) Group members could trigger each other trap (eg: your follower triggering your trap).
(3) (Stability) AI detected to attempt illegal or looping actions will not crash or lock the game anymore.

SURFACE MAPGEN
- New layout variant for houses : apartments, aka "cramped places of death".

PRISON MAPGEN
- Cells doors are now unbreakable, because NPCs will now actually try to break free when trapped!

HOSPITAL MAPGEN
- Increased max number of nurses starting trapped in hospital storage rooms.

AI
- Civilian followers are now much more likely to lay traps and build fortifications.
- NPCs leaders are a bit less likely to get stuck waiting for followers forever.
- NPCs will not pick up traps layed by themselves or their group.
- Hungry civs searching for food will angrily push objects around only when inside. Pushing cars outside is not productive
- Penalise AI backtracking when wandering. Encourage using doors and exits, and inside when sleepy

MISC
- Book bore chance up to 10% (was 5%)
- City Size option has now no effect on difficulty. There are both advantages and disadvantages for large cities so in the end it evens up.

FOR DEVS
- New experimental Bot Mode in Debug build only: AI takes control of player.
- Press INSERT to toggle ai taking control of the player.
- Will work for any ActorModel that has a default controller defined. As of alpha 10.1 that means all actors.
- The character controlled by the bot is still considered as the player by most of the game rules, the other AIs etc...
- Remember AIs do not leave districts so the bot won't either.
- The Bot will handle everything a player has to do : answer trade offers, choose skills upgrades etc...
- When the Bot is exploring, keep in mind it make no use of the player fov memory of the maps, so it is suboptimal when
exploring for the player. Also the ais make no use of the messages the player is receiving like "you hear fighting..." etc...

(Gfx) Fixed overlays sometimes being cleared when they should not.
(Rules) Fixed running actors not dropping scents on every tile they run through.
(Gfx) Fixed special dialogues overlays not cleared when closed.
(AI) Char Guards only warn trespassers they can still see. Note due to fov being asymetric, sometimes they can see you while you can't see them.

(Rules) Actors dragging corpse cannot push/pull/shove anymore.
(Rules) Pushing/Shoving did not properly check tiles triggers.
(GUI) Fixed situation were was saying "Hint available" but when asked to show the hint had none.
(Misc) Fixed "that person" in "that place" hailing the player even when not visible to the player.

NEW ACTION : PULL  (default Ctrl-P)
- Similar to pushing, select an adjacent object/actor to pull, then select an adjacent tile you can walk to.
- If possible, the pulled object/actor will be forcibly moved into your tile, and you move into the walkable tile you selected.

NEW GAMEPLAY : DISARM
- Each successful melee attack has a chance to disarm the defender. Base chance is 5%.
- Martial Arts skill adds +10% per level.
- Defender's Strong skill resists disarm by 5% per level.
- Some melee weapons give disarm bonus as well.
- The item on right/left hand will be dropped in an adjacent tile if possible.
- Rats and Skeletons cannot disarm!

NEW GAMEPLAY : NEGOCIATING TRADE
- New action: Negociate Trade. Default key E. Select an adjacent npc willing to trade.
- Opens a window where you can offer or ask for items.
- You see your inventory and the npc inventory.
- Items are color coded so you can see if the npc will accept or not and if your Charismatic skill had an effect or not.
- Removed now obsolete action "offer item to trade".
- "Fast" trade by bumping into a npc is still there.
- A succesful trade recovers some Sanity for both parties.

STENCH KILLER OVERHAUL
- Stench Killer is now sprayed on actors not tiles.
- You can spray it on yourself or adjacent actors.
- It suppress all the actor scents for a number of turns : the actor won't drop scents on the tiles.
- Works on any actor, living or undead.
- The suppression is subject to decay like other odors (effect of rain on outdoor tiles, etc...).

TRAPS

- Traps that are safe for the player have green icons and description mentions who setup the trap.
- Undeads are 30% more likely to trigger traps.
- Light Feet skill bonus to avoid/escape traps bumped to +15% (was +5%).

RANGED WEAPONS FIRING
- When firing the interface now shows your average hit chances for each shot and which fire mode you are using.
- Redone how "Rapid Fire" works, as no one ever used it. Now it is actually an option to consider especially with the Firearms skill.
- Rapid Fire attack values are now a stat of the ranged weapons, some are a bit better than others at rapid fire.
Before it was just a flat penalty to each shot irrevelant of the weapon used. As before, Rapid Fire makes you shoot twice for the cost of only one action.
Keep in mind "rapid fire" means you are not taking the time to aim properly between shots, not that you are using automatic fire or not. Automatic fire doesn't "exist" in the game and is just reflected in the weapons damage or attack stats, some weapons are always assumed to be fired in burst and an "ammo" for them does not represent a single bullet. That was a clarification for weapon nerds out there :)
- The game remembers your fire mode so you don't have to switch each time you fire.
- Distance to target is now a % modifier on the ranged attack value and has a bigger effect on hit chances, especially beyond efficient range.
- Firing penalties (eg sleepy) apply to standard and rapid fire shots

NEW GAMEPLAY : MELEE WEAPONS AS TOOLS
- Some melee weapons can be "tools". Eg: hammer, crowbar...
- Equipped tools give bonuses when breaking, barricading, repairing or building.
- Some tools are better at breaking than building and vice-versa. Eg: the crowbar is best at breaking stuff, the small hammer at building and repairing.
- Read the melee weapon item description to learn each tool weapon bonuses.

GROUP AND ENEMIES
- Groups now share enemies :
- "The enemies of my leader are my enemies"
eg. A civilian lead by a cop will be enemies with gangs because the cop faction is enemy with the gang faction.
- "The enemies of my mates are my enemies"
eg. You decide to attack another civilian. Your follower will be enemy with him too.
- "The enemies of my followers are my enemies"
eg. A biker aggress you for your item. All the biker group will now be your enemies too. All your followers will be their enemies too.
- You got a new follower but he is a murderer. If cops go after the murderer they will go after you too.
- To "get rid" of the problem of being enemy of a whole group because you have a "problem" with one of them you have
to break the group links with him, so kill the guy you have a problem with (eg: the one who agressed you) or kill the group leader.
- Look at the icons and the actors descriptions to understand why they are your enemies.

SKILL UPGRADE INTERFACE
- Skill Upgrade choices are now shown in a window. Less cramped than message logs!
- Works for upgrading your followers too and you also see their current skills listed.

SANITY REBALANCE
- Increased Sanity recovery for having a follower with a bond or killing undeads.

WEATHER & TIME OF DAY AWARENESS
- Weather is now more dynamic. It stays the same for a very short or very long period of time and then will change, rather than daily.
So you can have anything from short burst of rains for a few hours to long sunny days and it can change at any time
- If you can't see the sky (sleeping or sewers/basements maps) :
- you are not told the time of the day.
- you are not told the weather and informed of weather changes.
- Cellphones and Police Radios can give you the time of the day.

- In debug mode there is code to detect if an ai is looping "ai loop bug detection". You should add a breakpoint here.

--------------------

Features:
-Added nail guns.
-Living AIs may now make molotovs.

Fixes:
-Config files (saves, scores, screenshots) now save to \Documents\Rogue Survivor\, which allows non-admins to run the game.

|Healing rounds down, so it was really only 10%, and that meant medkits only gave 1 extra HP with the skill.
-Fixed bug where the Prisoner With No Name is already freed before the player stands in front of their cell, but the dialog was still initiated.

--------------------

Features:

-Original grenade sfx now assigned to dynamite. Grenades given a new sfx.

|'Intelligent' NPCs (livings, evolved undead) don't risk stepping on fire when exploring/wandering if it will kill
	or seriously hurt them, like with traps, unless they are desperate for food or stupidly courageous.

Fixes:
-Fixed lack of fragility of certain melee weapons.
-Tailored the warning message when stamina is too low to climb on/over an object.
-Destroying walls now also removes decorations (eg shop signage).
-Cops now might only trade their gun or radio if they are hungry and have no food.
-'Dumb' undead now no longer consider traps when exploring.
-'Intelligent' AI are now less likely to plow through traps without care.
-More realistic items in General Stores.
-To be more realistic, extended the expiry of groceries and removed the expiry of army rations.

-Alleviated some of the hoarding that AI do, especially pills and ammo.

Development:
-Added a check between IsHungry and IsStarving called IsActorReallyHungry.
